# FlexBox Classroom

ðŸš€ `Flexbox classroom is a web application for schools, teachers, instructors and facilitators to provide online learning and teaching. Parents can monitor their children's progress in real time. It can be used for study at home or on premises. Student performance data is automatically generated. Which can be analysed to strategise new teaching and learning techniques. And to reach our main vision, which is to use this data to build teaching or learning models using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to come up with the best effective way of learning and teaching.` ðŸš€

## Starting Point

I have already created the following routes :

-   POST:  /auth/register [register](http://localhost:4000/auth/register)
-   POST:  /auth/register [login](http://localhost:4000/auth/login)
-   GET:  /profile/ [profile](http://localhost:4000/profile/register)

## Quick start

-   You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.22.1/) installed, this project has been tested with Node version `12.X` and `14.X`

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/donaldmo/flexbox.git

# install dependencies
npm install

# start the server
npm run start

# start the server with nodemon
npm run dev
```

-   Open http://localhost:4000 in browser
