# FlexBox Classroom

ðŸš€ `description of the application here` ðŸš€

## Starting Point

I have already created the following routes :

-   POST:  /auth/register [register](http://localhost:4000/auth/register)
-   POST:  /auth/register [login](http://localhost:4000/auth/login)
-   GET:  /profile/ [profile](http://localhost:4000/profile/register)

## Quick start

-   You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v12.22.1/) installed, this project has been tested with Node version `12.X` and `14.X`

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/donaldmo/flexbox.git

# install dependencies
npm install

# start the server
npm run start

# start the server with nodemon
npm run dev
```

-   Open http://localhost:4000 in browser

---

## Testing Routes

You can test the routes using postman or VS Code Extention Rest Client :

-   POSTMAN:  https://www.postman.com/
-   VS Code extention Rest Client: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client
-   Using Rest Clent: open directory `/rest.http/auth.http` and `/rest.http/profile.http`
